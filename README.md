# Martin-Luther-King-Jr.-Tribute-Page
A simple tribute page that applies the basics of html and css. Some of the elements that were used
were the main tag, that stores the main section of the page including the image, the description as well as other
nested tags like the section tag that was used to display and organization the tribute information.

The purpose of this projet was to practice some of the resposive web design properties I have learned and monitor my progress.
